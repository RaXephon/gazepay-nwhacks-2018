# Gaze Pay

GazePay is a face recognition based payment system for point of sale terminals. The goal is to eventually replace credit cards with biometrics (like face, retinal and/or fingerprint scan). This was build for nwHacks 2018 as a single day hackathon project.

`backend` folder contains all the backend code for face recognition and the implementation of the database system for payments. `frontend` contains the code for the UI that allows POS payment.
